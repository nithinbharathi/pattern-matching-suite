This repository features an index.c file dedicated to constructing an FM-index for large DNA sequences. 
The FM-index is a space-efficient data structure that enables fast substring searches, making it ideal for bioinformatics applications. The current implementation uses bit vectors and  supports search operations like MEM finding using Heng Li's forward backward algorithm and counting occurences of a pattern.
