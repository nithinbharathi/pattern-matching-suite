This repository features an index.c file dedicated to constructing an FM-index for large DNA sequences. 
The FM-index is a space-efficient data structure that enables fast substring searches, making it ideal for bioinformatics applications. It implemented using bit vectors and currently supports
search operations like MEM finding using Heng Li's forward backward algorithm and counting occurences of a pattern.
